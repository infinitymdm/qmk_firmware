# Mirydoxu Layout for Redox

The Mirydoxu layout takes inspiration from [miryoku](https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku/tree/master/docs/reference)
and adapts its strengths to the Redox keyboard. The key ideas are the same:
* Use both layers instead of reaching.
* Use both hands instead of contortions.
* Use home positions as much as possible.*
* Make full use of the thumbs.
* Avoid unnecessary complications.
###### *Since the Redox has so many more keys than miryoku was designed for, we do this a bit less.

> Note: I'm a QWERTY user, so I've set Mirydoxu up that way. Feel free
to fork and adapt it to your needs. Layout switching, like in real 
miryoku, might get added in the future. No promises!

Because the Redox has nearly double the number of keys Miryoku was
designed for, Mirydoxu is more like a blend of typical Redox paradigms
and Miryoku's ideas. Number keys (and corresponding function keys) are
in their usual places. Likewise we retain shift keys and many modifier
keys. Other differences include:
* Numpad is on the right hand
* Media keys are on the left hand
* Most of the customization options are not (yet) available
* An additional `GAME` layer is included for us gamers
